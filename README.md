## What it does:

This JAVA Program takes multiple images from a selectes folder and creates with a selectes width and height a random collage. It works with different sized images and different ratio images, so no pre-processing is necessary. Additionally, there are two available shapes to choose from: *Rectangle* and *Hexagon* 

Perfect for creating posters wit A LOT of images

Example results (2000x1500 rectangles):
